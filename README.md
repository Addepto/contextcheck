# contextcheck

⚠️ Under development

- Test scenario definition by .yaml files
- Endpoint configuration (openai, http)
- JSON request/response 
- Variables and Jinja2 templating for yaml files
- Response validation using `eval`

## Getting started

For now, this is just:

```

Config files are hardcoded :)
