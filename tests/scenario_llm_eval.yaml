  about_einstein: |
    Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned German-born physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. 
    He is best known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between energy and mass.
    Einstein's work had a profound impact on our understanding of space, time, and gravity. 
    His theory of general relativity revolutionized the field of physics and led to a deeper understanding of the universe. 
    He also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and the photoelectric effect. 
    In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein was a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and social justice. 
    He was a strong critic of nationalism and militarism, and he believed that science and technology should be used to benefit humanity, 
    not just a select few. Einstein's legacy extends far beyond the world of physics. His name has become synonymous with genius, creativity, and intellectual curiosity. 
    He is an inspiration to people all over the world who are interested in science, philosophy, and the pursuit of knowledge.

  about_newton_summary: |
    Isaac Newton was a renowned physicist and mathematician who is best known for his laws of motion and universal gravitation. 
    He made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, and his work laid the foundation for classical mechanics. 
    Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between an object's mass, force, and acceleration, and his law of universal gravitation explains 
    the force of attraction between two objects. Newton's discoveries revolutionized the field of physics and had a profound impact on our 
    understanding of the natural world.
