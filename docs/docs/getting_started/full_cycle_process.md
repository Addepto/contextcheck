# Full-cycle process

On a high-level, the full-cycle process, involves following steps:

* Write a simple plug-in that connects ContextCheck to your RAG system. Specifically, you will need to write a small wrapper that will "talk" to document database used for document retrieval.

* Use ContextCheck script to generate set of synthetic questions. Depending on the amount of documents in your documents database, be default, you will receive 30 questions per each document.

* Manually go through the list of generated questions to select final list of questions that.

* **# TODO:** Finish. 
  Use separate ContextCheck script that loads generated questions, use RAG endpoint to generate answers, and save them in test scenario YAML format. 

* Manually revise answers generated by RAG
