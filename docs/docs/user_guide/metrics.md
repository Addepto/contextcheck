## About metrics

ContextCheck uses two types of metrics to evaluate responses from LLM or RAG systems: deterministic metrics and LLM-based metrics.

Deterministic metrics perform straightforward, rule-based checks on the AI's answers, while LLM-based metrics use another LLM to conduct more sophisticated, human-like assessments of response quality and accuracy.

For details, refer to:

* [LLM-based metrics](llm_based_metrics.md)
